      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
      Gitless is an experimental version control system built on top of Git.
      Many people complain that Git is hard to use. We think the problem lies
      deeper than the user interface, in the concepts underlying Git. Gitless
      is an experiment to see what happens if you put a simple veneer on an app
      that changes the underlying concepts. Because Gitless is implemented on
      top of Git (could be considered what Git pros call a "porcelain" of Git),
      you can always fall back on Git. And of course your coworkers you share a
      repo with need never know that you're not a Git aficionado.
      </p>

      <p>
      Check out the <a href="http://gitless.com/#documentation">documentation</a> to get started.
      If you are new to version control, the
      documentation should be enough to get you started. If you are a Git pro
      looking to see what's different from your beloved Git you'll be able to
      spot the differences by glancing through the
      <a href="http://gitless.com/#vs">Gitless vs. Git</a> section.

      <a id="repository"><h3>Creating a Repository</h3></a>
      <p>
      Say you are in directory <code>foo</code> and you want turn it into a
      repository. You do this with the
      <code><a id="gl-init">gl init</a></code> command. This transforms
      the current working directory into an empty repository and you
      are now ready to start saving changes to files in <code>foo</code>:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> mkdir foo
<span class="shell">$</span> cd foo/
<span class="shell">$</span> gl init
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Local repo created in /MyFiles/foo</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
      In most cases there's already some existing repository you
      want to work on instead of starting with an empty repository. To make a
      local clone of a remote repository you can pass the URL of the repository
      as input to the same <code>gl init</code> command:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> mkdir experiment
<span class="shell">$</span> cd experiment/
<span class="shell">$</span> gl init https://github.com/spderosso/experiment
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Local repo created in /MyFiles/foo</span>
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Initialized from remote https://github.com/spderosso/experiment</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <a id="changes"><h3>Saving Changes</h3></a>
      <p>
      Now that you have your local repository, it's time to start saving
      changes to files. A file in Gitless can be <em>tracked</em>,
      <em>untracked</em> or <em>ignored</em>.
      A <em>tracked file</em> is a file whose changes Gitless will detect.
      Tracked files are automatically considered for commit if they are
      modified and appear listed under the "Tracked files with modifications"
      section of <code>status</code>.
      Conversely, an <em>untracked file</em> is a file whose changes Gitless
      will not detect. These are not automatically considered for commit and
      appear listed under the "Untracked files" section of
      <code>status</code>.
      Finally, an <em>ignored file</em> is a file that is completely ignored by
      Gitless and it won't even appear in the output of <code>status</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      An example output of the <code><a id="gl-status">gl status</a></code>
      command
      (<code>foo.py</code> and <code>bar.py</code> are tracked files
      with modifications, <code>.gitignore</code> is an unmodified tracked file,
      <code>baz.py</code> is an untracked file and <code>foo.pyc</code> is an
      ignored file):
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> ls
bar.py  baz.py  foo.py  foo.pyc .gitignore
<span class="shell">$</span> gl status
On branch <span class="ansi-green">master</span>, repo-directory <span class="ansi-green">//</span>

Tracked files with modifications:
  ➜ these will be automatically considered for commit
  ➜ use gl untrack &lt;f&gt; if you don't want to track changes to file f
  ➜ if file f was committed before, use gl checkout &lt;f&gt; to discard local changes

    <span class="ansi-yellow">foo.py</span>
    <span class="ansi-yellow">bar.py</span>

Untracked files:
  ➜ these won't be considered for commit)
  ➜ use gl track &lt;f&gt; if you want to track changes to file f

    <span class="ansi-blue">baz.py</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
      Now, how do files move between these three different <em>disjoint</em>
      states?
      </p>
      <p>
      A file is ignored if it's matched by the ignore specification described in
      a <code>.gitignore</code> file.
      In the example above,
      there is a <code>.gitignore</code> file whose content is '*.pyc'; since
      <code>foo.pyc</code> is matched by that pattern it's therefore an
      ignored file.
      </p>
      <p>
      A new file that is not matched by the ignore spec is initially an untracked
      file. If you want to track it you can do so with the
      <code><a id="gl-track">gl track</a></code> command. You can stop tracking
      changes to a tracked file
      with the <code><a id="gl-untrack">gl untrack</a></code> command.
      You can always revert a file back to some previous version with the
      <code><a id="gl-checkout">gl checkout</a></code> command.
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl track baz.py
<span class="ansi-green">✔ File baz.py is now a tracked file</span>
<span class="shell">$</span> gl track baz.py
<span class="ansi-red">✘ File baz.py is already a tracked file</span>
<span class="shell">$</span> gl untrack baz.py
<span class="ansi-green">✔ File baz.py is now an untracked file</span>
<span class="shell">$</span> gl checkout foo.py
You have uncommitted changes in foo.py that would be
overwritten by checkout. Do you wish to continue? (y/N)
&gt; y
<span class="ansi-green">✔ File foo.py checked out successfully to its state at HEAD</span></code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
      To save changes to files you use
      <code><a id="gl-commit">gl commit</a></code>.
      By default, all tracked modified files are considered
      for commit, but the set of files to commit can be customized with the
      <code>o/only</code>, <code>e/exclude</code>, and <code>i/include</code>
      flags:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "foo and bar"
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "only foo" -o foo.py
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "only foo and baz" -o foo.py baz.py
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "only foo" -e bar.py
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "only foo and baz" -e bar.py -i baz.py
<span class="shell">$</span> gl commit -m "foo, bar and baz" -i baz.py</code></pre></div>
      <p>
      There's also a <code>p/partial</code> flag that allows you to
      interactively select segments of files to commit.
      </p><p>
      </p><p>
      The <code><a id="gl-diff">gl diff</a></code> command can be used to see the
      difference between the working and committed versions of files. Like
      <code>commit</code>, the default set of files to diff is
      the set of all tracked modified files but it can be customized with the
      <code>o/only</code>, <code>e/exclude</code>, and <code>i/include</code>
      flags.
      </p>

 
      <a id="branching"><h3>Branching</h3></a>
      <p>
      A branch is an independent line of development. You are always working
      on some branch. Each branch has its own history (which you can look at
      with the <a id="gl-history">gl history</a> command). Any changes to
      existing files or new files you create on a branch will not be present on
      the other branch when you switch branches.
      </p>
      <p>To create a new branch you use the
      <a id="gl-branch">gl branch</a>
      command. To switch to another branch you use the
      <a id="gl-switch">gl switch</a> command:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl branch -c develop
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Created new branch develop</span>
<span class="shell">$</span> gl switch my-branch
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Switched to branch develop</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>
      To list all branches:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl branch
List of branches:
  ➜ do gl branch &lt;b&gt; to create branch b
  ➜ do gl branch -d &lt;b&gt; to delete branch b
  ➜ do gl switch &lt;b&gt; to switch to branch b
  ➜ * = current branch

    <span class="ansi-green">* master</span>
      <span class="ansi-yellow">develop</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
      Each branch has a head which is the last commit done on the branch. To
      change the head of a branch you use the <code>sh/set-head</code> flag.
      This won't touch your working directory, if you additionaly want to
      reset your working directory to match the new head you use
      <code>gl checkout</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      Eventually branches will end up having divergent
      changes. There are two ways to bring changes from one branch onto the
      current branch: <em>merge</em> and <em>fuse</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Merging branches.</em>
      For merging the changes in <code>develop</code> onto the current branch
      you do <code><a id="gl-merge">gl merge develop</a></code>. This creates
      a new merge commit that includes the changes in <code>develop</code> in
      addition to those changes in the current branch:
      </p>
      <div class="fig">
        <img src="./Gitless_files/merge.png" alt="merge">
      </div>


      <p>
      <em>Fusing branches.</em> Fusing branches gives you more control than
      merging. When you fuse changes from some branch onto the
      current branch you can specify the commits to fuse and the insertion
      point. By default, all divergent commits are fused and the insertion
      point is the divergent point (the point where the source branch diverged
      from the current).
      For example, the following figure depicts a situation in which there are
      two branches, <code>master</code> (the current branch) and
      <code>develop</code>. The last commit these two branches have in common is
      <code>A</code>. This commit is the "divergent point" (because
      it is the point at which <code>master</code> and <code>develop</code>
      diverged).
      After doing <code><a id="gl-fuse">gl fuse develop</a></code>, the commits
      in <code>develop</code> are inserted in <code>master</code> after the
      divergent point:
      </p>
      <div class="fig">
        <img src="./Gitless_files/fuse.png" alt="fuse" class="fig">
      </div>
      <p>
      To choose other insertion points you use the
      <code>ip/insertion-point</code> flag. You can give a commit id as input,
      <code>head</code> or <code>dp/divergent-point</code>:
      </p>
      <div class="fig">
        <img src="./Gitless_files/fuse_ip.png" alt="fuse with insertion point specified">
      </div>
      <p>
      The <code>o/only</code> and <code>e/exclude</code> flags can be used to
      customize the set of commits to be fused:
      </p>
      <div class="fig">
        <img src="./Gitless_files/fuse_ip_o.png" alt="fuse with insertion point and commit specified">
      </div>
      <p>
      During this process conflicts could occur. If so, the <code>gl status</code> command will change
      accordingly to indicate the files in conflict. Once you edit those files in
      conflict you mark them as resolved with
      <code><a id="gl-resolve">gl resolve</a></code> (passing the files to mark as input). Once all
      conflicts have been resolved
      you do <code>gl commit</code> to commit to continue with the fuse or
      merge.
      </p>
      <p>
      A branch can have an "upstream branch." If a branch has an upstream
      associated with it, then <code>gl fuse</code> or <code>gl merge</code> can
      be used as shorthands for <code>gl {fuse, merge} upstream_branch</code>.
      To set an upstream branch for the current branch use
      <code>gl branch -su upstream_branch</code>.
      </p>


      <a id="tagging"><h3>Tagging</h3></a>
      <p>
      You use tags to signify a commit is special in some way. For example, you
      can use <code><a id="gl-tag">gl tag</a></code> to create a tag with name
      "v1.0" and make it point to the commit that represents release v1.0:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl tag -c v1.0
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Created new tag v1.0</span>
</code></pre>
      </div>
      <p>In this case, the tag will point to the head of the current branch, but
      you can tag other commits with the <code>ci/commit</code> flag.
      </p>
      <p>
      To list all tags:
      </p>
      <div class="code">
      <pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl tag
List of tags:
  ➜ do gl tag &lt;t&gt; to create tag t
  ➜ do gl tag -d &lt;t&gt; to delete tag t

    v1.0 ➜  tags <span class="ansi-yellow">311bf7c</span> Ready to release
</code></pre>
      </div>


      <a id="remote"><h3>Working with Remote Repositories</h3></a>
      <p>
      To refer to a remote repository you could always use its URL, but an
      easier alternative is to add the repository as a "remote" with the
      <code><a id="gl-remote">gl remote</a></code> command:
      </p>
      <div class="code"><pre><code><span class="shell">$</span> gl remote -c experiment https://github.com/spderosso/experiment
<span class="ansi-green">✔ Remote experiment mapping to https://github.com/spderosso/experiment created

  ➜ to list existing remotes do gl remote
  ➜ to remove experiment do gl remote -d experiment

      <p>
      Now you can use <code>experiment</code> to refer to this remote repository
      and use <code>experiment/some-branch</code> to refer to the branch of name
      <code>some-branch</code> that lives in <code>experiment</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Downloading Changes.</em>
      It is also possible to fuse or merge changes from remote
      branches. For example, doing <code>gl merge experiment/master</code>
      would merge changes in that remote branch that are not present in your
      local current branch. You can also use <code>gl fuse</code>.
      </p>
      <p>
      <em>Uploading Changes.</em>
      To send changes upstream you use
      <code><a id="gl-publish">gl publish</a></code>. The publish command will
      default to updating the upstream branch of the current branch if none is
      given as input. What if you want to create or delete a remote branch? You
      can do so with the <code>gl branch</code> command. If you do
      <code>gl branch -c experiment/develop</code> this will create a branch
      <code>develop</code> that lives in the remote experiment
      (same for delete). To list remote branches use the
      <code>r/remote</code> flag of <code>gl branch</code>. Creating or deleting
      remote tags works the same way as with remote branches. If you do
      <code>gl tag -c experiment/v1.0</code> this will create a new tag
      <code>v0.1</code> that lives in the remote experiment. You can also list
      remote tags with the <code>r/remote</code> flag of <code>gl tag</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
      When you create a local repository from a remote (by passing a URL as
      input to the <code>gl init</code> command), a local branch is created
      for each remote branch, and each local branch is automatically configured
      to have as upstream its remote counterpart.

      <h2>Branching</h2>
      <p>
      The main thing to understand is that in Gitless a branch is a completely
      independent line of development. Each branch keeps its working version
      of files separate from each other. Whenever you switch to a different
      branch, the contents of your working directory are saved, and the ones
      corresponding to the branch you are switching to are retrieved. The
      classifications of files are also saved (i.e., a file can
      be untracked on some branch but tracked on another and Gitless will
      remember this):
